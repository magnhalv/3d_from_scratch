- [ ] Fix camera. Both dev cam with free-mode movement, and camera for game.
- [ ] Add controls using controller. Rotate top using right-pad.
- [ ] Consider adding a hidden point for where to fire from.
- [ ] Add hit box support
- [X] Figure out how to rotate sub-mesh in origin.

    and back again.


// Later

- [ ] Use CMake + Ninja to build the system.
